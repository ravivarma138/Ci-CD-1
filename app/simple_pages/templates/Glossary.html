            <h1><Strong>Glossary Of OOP Terms </strong></h1>
            <p>1.Instantiation :</p><br>
            <p>instantiation (countable and uncountable, plural instantiations) (uncountable) The production of an
                instance, example, or specific application of a general classification, principle, theory, etc.
                (countable) Something resulting from the act of instantiating; an instance.</p><br>
            <p>2.Namespace:</p><br>
            <p>In computing, a namespace is a set of signs (names) that are used to identify and refer to objects of
                various kinds. A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can
                be easily identified.</p><br>
            <p>3.Class:</p><br>
            <p>A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.</p> <br>
            <p>4.Object:</p><br>
            <p>an object is an element (or instance) of a class; objects have the behaviors of their class.</p><br>
            <p>5.Fixture:</p><br>
            <p>A test fixture is a fixed state of a set of objects used as a baseline for running tests. The purpose of
                a test fixture is to ensure that there is a well known and the fixed environment in which tests are run
                so that results are repeatable.</p><br>
            <p>6.Type hint</p><br>
            <p>In a type hint, if we specify a type (class), then we mark the variable as containing an instance of that
                type. To specify that a variable instead contains a type, we need to use type[Cls] (or the old syntax
                typing</p><br>
            <p>7.Type cast :</p><br>
            <p>There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting.
                Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its
                primitive types.

                Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:<br>

                int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all
                decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)<br>
                float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal
                (providing the string represents a float or an integer)<br>
                str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and
                float literals</p><br>
            <p>8.Unit Test:</p><br>
            <p> Unit Testing is the first level of software testing where the smallest testable parts of a software are
                tested. This is used to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.</p><br>
            <p>9.Instance method</p>
            <p>An instance method is a method that belongs to instances of a class, not to the class itself. To define
                an instance method, just omit static from the method heading. Within the method definition, you refer to
                variables and methods in the class by their names, without a dot.</p><br>
            <p>10.Encapsulation </p><br>
            <p>Binding the data with the code that manipulates it and
                It keeps the data and the code safe from external interference </p> <br>
            <p>11.Abstraction </p> <br>
            <p>One of the most fundamental concept of OOPs is Abstraction. Abstraction is a process where you show only
                “relevant” data and “hide” unnecessary details of an object from the user</p> <br>
            <p>12.polymorphism </p><br>
            <p> means to process objects differently based on their data type.
                In other words it means, one method with multiple implementation, for a certain class of action. And
                which implementation to be used is decided at runtime depending upon the situation (i.e., data type of
                the object)
                This can be implemented by designing a generic interface, which provides generic methods for a certain
                class of action and there can be multiple classes, which provides the implementation of these generic
                methods.</p> <br>
            <p>13.Inheritance</p><br>
            <p>Inheritance is the mechanism by which an object acquires the some/all properties of another object.
                It supports the concept of hierarchical classification.</p><br>
            <p>14.Abstraction:</p>
            <p>Abstraction is a process where you show only “relevant” data and “hide” unnecessary details of an object
                from the user. For example, when you login to your Amazon account online, you enter your user_id and
                password and press login, what happens when you press login, how the input data sent to amazon server,
                how it gets verified is all abstracted away from the you.</p><br>
            <p><strong>Overview of SOLID</strong></p>
            <p>SOLID is an acronym for five principles that help software developers design maintainable and extendable
                classes. It stands for Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation
                and Dependency inversion.<br>
            <p><strong>Single Responsibility Principle
                A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.</strong></p><br>
            <p><strong> Open-Closed Principle
                You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.</strong></p><br>
            <p><strong>Liskov Substitution Principle
                Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.<br>Interface Segregation Principle
                Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.<br>Dependency Inversion Principle
                Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.<br></strong><a
                    href="https://team-coder.com/solid-principles/#:~:text=SOLID%20is%20an%20acronym%20for,Interface%20segregation%20and%20Dependency%20inversion.">More

            <p><strong>Overview of Design Patterns:</strong><br>Design patterns represent the best practices used by
                experienced object-oriented software developers. Design patterns are solutions to general problems that
                software developers faced during software development.<br>Types of Design Patterns
                As per the design pattern reference book Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software
                , there are 23 design patterns which can be classified in three categories:<br>Types of Design Patterns
