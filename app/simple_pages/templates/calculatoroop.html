        <h1><strong>Calculator explaining OOPS concepts</strong></h1>
        <p>@staticmethod<br>
            def add(tuple_list) <br>
            """this is a method"""<br>
            calculation=Addition.create(tuple_list);<br>
            return caculation.get_result()<br></p>

        <strong>This is the code from calculator project in which we could identify encapsulation and
            abstraction.</strong>
    </div>
</div>

<p><strong>1.Encapsulation:</strong></p><br>
<p>the main event is encapsulation in the above code because the addition instance which is stored in calculation
    variable<br>
    encapsulates the data and functionality of the data to get the result.<br>
    The tuple data is encapsulated along with the method to work on the data.</p>
<div class="container">
    <div class="center">

        <p>Class Addition(calculation)<br>
            sum_of values=0.0<br>
            """this is a method"""<br>
            for values in self.values:<br>
            sum_of_values=Add.add(sum_of_values)<br>
            return sum_of_values;<br></p>

        <strong>This is the code from calculator project in which we could identify polymorphism</strong>
    </div>
</div>
<p><strong>2.Polymorphism</strong></p>
<p>we have addition object which gets result of addition, and so is with other method.<br>

    if an object knows about its method and performs the necessary operation then it is called polymorphism.<br>

    Similarly if we look at the first example, we have a method called getresult() which know its own functionality and
    thus exhibits polymorphism<br></p>

<p><strong>3.Abstraction:</strong></p>

<p>Data abstraction is to make few parts of a class or an object data visible <br>
    In the first example code there is a get_result method<br>
    abstraction is also there because the get_result usually calls a loop in which there a process hidden to perform the
    addition.<br>
    the functionality of get result is not visible</p>
<p><strong>4.Inheritance:</strong></p>

<p>Inheritance is the property used to extract or inherit properties of a class into another class<br>
    There is a parent class from which the child inherits properties.<br>
    In the above Addition class example : <br>
    If you look at the line "Class Addition(calculator)"<br>
    This defines that Addition is a child class which inherits propeerties from the parent class Calculator.<br></p>
